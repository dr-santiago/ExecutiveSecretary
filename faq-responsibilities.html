        <h3>Letter from President</h3>
        <p>For every missionary, President will send you a Word document that has two pages; one is a letter for the
            stake president and the other is for the family. The family letter gets printed and put into the packet, and
            the stake president letter gets saved as a PDF and sent to him. To do that, you must:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Word document from President and fix any grammatical or spelling errors. Send those errors back
                to him so that he can save that as his new template (English only ‚Äì he does all of the Spanish ones.)
            </li>
            <li>Press Ctrl + Print and set the destination to Microsoft Print to PDF instead of the actual printer.</li>
            <li>Select the page range to only print the stake president letter as a PDF. The family one will get
                literally printed and put into the packet.</li>
            <li>Go to the files in outgoing missionary letters for English or Spanish missionaries. Make sure to include
                the President‚Äôs image signature. Attach the stake president letter to the email and send it. Also attach
                the itinerary for those missionaries flying out of the country.</li>
            <li>Make sure to blind copy it to the president.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The first priority on Monday is to check and make sure that all of the flights are on time and not delayed.
            This means that you should check every 30 minutes on each airline‚Äôs respective website. You can also just
            google the flight number (AA 2157, for example) and the flight times will show up. Notify the office group
            chat every 30 minutes. You should know at any given moment where every inbound missionary is. President will
            ask.</p>

        <p>When the missionaries start to arrive, it is normal for them to arrive at the mission home while you are in
            the office. This is because president needs to interview every missionary upon arrival, as well as feed them
            and keep them occupied. You will make your way over to the mission home when president says (you might need
            to ask) because there, you will begin the document collection process.</p>

            <li>Find the list of incoming missionaries on IMOS or the Excel spreadsheet titled ‚ÄúLlegadas y Salidas.‚Äù
                Every missionary needs a small, manilla envelope with their name on it in sharpie for them to put their
                documents in. Refer to the <a href="#when-arrive">when missionaries arrive</a> section to
                see which items to collect.</li>
            <li>Collect all of these items from the missionaries, and then start taking their pictures. There is a
                whiteboard on the terrace of President‚Äôs house in the back next to the wooden table, which serves as a
                great backdrop. These pictures need to be as good as they can be so that we don't have to retake them.

        <ol>
            <li>Each passport and visa needs to be scanned and saved to the computer. You can choose your own way to

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Place a passport with the passport page down on the scanner and press Escanear on the menu.
                        Press Secretario on the list of emails to send the scan to and then make sure that it is in
                        color. Press Inicio. It will then start scanning.</li>
                    <li>Open the lid when it is done scanning and flip to the visa page. Press Inicio to start the scan.
                    </li>
                    <li>To finish the scan, press Finaliz. on the blue drop-down box at the top of the screen. That scan
                        will show up in the Scans inbox on the office outlook inbox. You can rename all of the scans in
                        Last, First Middle name format after you have scanned all of the documents.</li>
                    <li>Scan the front and the back of the covid card as well. You can name these as Elder/Hermana Last
                        Name, COVID Card and save them to the folder where you put the passports and COVID cards in.

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>After everything is in the computer, you will now need to get the pictures off of the phone and send
                them to yourself. You can do this by sending them on WhatsApp to the Financiero and then downloading
                them by pressing the three dots in the top right corner of the screen. Save them in this scheme:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The face-forward picture is always named Last, First Middle 1.</li>
                    <li>The right-facing side profile is always named Last, First Middle 2.</li>
                    <li>The left-facing side profile is always named Last, First Middle 3.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>You will then send an email to Zeneida that has all three of the pictures plus the scan of their
                passport and visa for every missionary. You can tell that you are not missing anything in the email when
                the number of attachments equals the amount of missionaries that arrived multiplied by four. Say this in
                the body of the email:

            <li>After you have scanned and sent everything, you will then need to make 65% size copies of their passport

                    <li>Change the size to 65% and place the passport with the passport page face down. When it is
